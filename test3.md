# # Lab | MLOps Deployment from PROD to DEV

## Introduction

The goal of this lab is to practice deploying models from a production environment back to a development environment using image segmentation. The lab includes hands-on exercises to help you understand and apply these concepts.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: 
   - In this lab, I worked on the `main.ipynb` file. To open it, I navigated to the directory containing the file and launched Jupyter Notebook with the following command:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This opened a webpage where I clicked on `main.ipynb` to start working on the lab.

2. **Follow the Instructions**: 
   - Once inside `main.ipynb`, I followed the instructions for each cell, completed the exercises, and tested my solutions by running the cells.
   - I made sure to save my progress periodically.

## Using GitHub Desktop and Git Bash

### GitHub Desktop
1. **Add and Commit Changes**:
   - After completing the lab, I used GitHub Desktop to add my changes. I selected the modified `main.ipynb` file and included a brief commit message describing the work I had done.
   - I clicked **Commit to main** to save my changes locally.

2. **Push to GitHub**:
   - After committing, I used the **Push origin** button in GitHub Desktop to push my branch to the remote repository on GitHub. This made my work accessible on GitHub and ready for review.

### Git Bash
Alternatively, I also used Git Bash to manage my version control. Hereâ€™s a summary of the commands I used:
1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your-project-directory
